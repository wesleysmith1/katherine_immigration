    Politician’s Statement #2: 
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    <p>
        “Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system."
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        <b>Fact Check:</b> Cash assistance for immigrants is very low, about 6 percent, but there are other programs
        from which immigrants benefit, and [the politician] cited benefits broadly. Research from the Center
        for Immigration Studies found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here
        legally or illegally) reported to have used at least one welfare program during the year.
    </p>

    <p>
        That percentage includes a broad definition of welfare, including school lunch. Excluding subsidized
        school lunches, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent, according to the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        The study included as welfare beneficiaries immigrant households in which a U.S.-born child is
        benefitting from a welfare program. Another report from the National Academies of Sciences,
        Engineering, and Medicine found that 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and
        46 percent had Medicaid.
