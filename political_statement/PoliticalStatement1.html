    Politician’s Statement #1: 
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    <p>
        “The [H.R.1] bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots, early voting, same-day voter
        registration, online voter registration, and automatic voter registration for any individual listed in
        state and federal government databases, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare
        offices, ensuring duplicate registrations and that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered
        to vote.”
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Fact Check:</b> The [new H.R.1] bill does not permit voting by noncitizens in U.S. elections, whether
        they’re in the country legally or not. A provision in the bill would require automatic voter
        registration for people using services at government agencies. However, that section says
        government agencies would only pass along a person’s information for voter registration if they are
        citizens. [With the new H.R.1 bill,] People would still be attesting that they are eligible to vote, with
        penalties for lying, and it would still be up to election officials to verify eligibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of the bill is to register eligible citizens.
