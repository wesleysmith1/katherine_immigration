    <p>
        You have now completed the survey. As indicated on the consent form you reviewed at the beginning of
        the survey, we will now provide you with additional information about the purpose of the survey. The
        purpose of this study is to evaluate how statements of misinformation and fact checks impact people’s
        policy preferences about immigration. In this study we observe how politicians&#39; statements (ranging
        from false to partially true) sway participants’ perceptions of immigration issues. We also collect data on
        how fact checks on politicians&#39; statements impact perceptions on immigration issues compared to only
        receiving the politicians&#39; statements. We also study the correlation between people’s political affiliation,
        demographics, etc. and the impact of the statements and fact checks.

    <h3>Facts and Statements</h3>

    <p>
        During this survey, you saw several statements. Each of these statements has been fact-
        checked by Politifact. Below, each of these statements is listed, along with the
        corresponding fact-check.
    </p>

    <h4>Statement 1</h4>

    <p>
        “The [H.R.1] bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots, early voting, same-day voter
        registration, online voter registration, and automatic voter registration for any individual listed in
        state and federal government databases, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare
        offices, ensuring duplicate registrations and that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered
        to vote.”
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Fact Check:</b> The [new H.R.1] bill does not permit voting by noncitizens in U.S. elections, whether
        they’re in the country legally or not. A provision in the bill would require automatic voter
        registration for people using services at government agencies. However, that section says
        government agencies would only pass along a person’s information for voter registration if they are
        citizens. [With the new H.R.1 bill,] People would still be attesting that they are eligible to vote, with
        penalties for lying, and it would still be up to election officials to verify eligibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of the bill is to register eligible citizens.
    </p>

    <h4>Statement 2</h4>

    <p>
        “Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system."
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Fact Check:</b> Cash assistance for immigrants is very low, about 6 percent, but there are other programs
        from which immigrants benefit, and [the politician] cited benefits broadly. Research from the Center
        for Immigration Studies found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here
        legally or illegally) reported to have used at least one welfare program during the year.
    </p>

    <p>
        That percentage includes a broad definition of welfare, including school lunch. Excluding subsidized
        school lunches, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent, according to the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        The study included as welfare beneficiaries immigrant households in which a U.S.-born child is
        benefitting from a welfare program. Another report from the National Academies of Sciences,
        Engineering, and Medicine found that 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and
        46 percent had Medicaid.
    </p>

    <h4>Statement 3</h4>

    <p>
        "In 2017, illegal aliens murdered 1,800 Americans.”
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Fact Check:</b> [A 2017 ICE] report tallies 1,531 homicide convictions and 355 homicide
        charges for people taken into ICE custody in 2017 for deportation, some after completing
        prison terms for their crimes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The convictions, however, represent crimes that took place over potentially several
        decades, and not necessarily in 2017, according to immigration experts. There’s also no
        accounting for how many of the homicide charges led to convictions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, the figures may also include some legal permanent residents, a group that’s
        much larger than those who are in the country illegally.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h4>Statement 4</h4>

    <p>
        "We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year."
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Fact Check:</b> According to the Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention, in 2017, more than 3.8 million births were recorded across
        the country. The Department of Homeland Security offers estimates for
        apprehension rates at the border and for how many people
        successfully enter the country illegally, based in part on observable
        data reported by agents on the ground and on statistical models. There
        were an estimated 104,000 ‘got aways’ in 2017 (an 83% decrease from
        615,000 in 2006) and 160,000 "total successful unlawful entries" in
        2017.
